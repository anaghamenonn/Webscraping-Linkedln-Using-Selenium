LinkedIn Job Scraper

Overview:
This Python script is designed to scrape job data from LinkedIn using Selenium. It automates the process of scrolling through job listings, extracting relevant information such as company names and job titles, and saving the data to a CSV file.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Selenium library
Chrome WebDriver
Pandas library

Note:
This script uses a headless Chrome browser for scraping, which means it runs without opening a visible browser window. If you encounter any issues, you can remove the --headless argument in the scrape_linkedin_jobs function to see the browser in action.
Ensure that your LinkedIn account settings allow public visibility of job listings; otherwise, the script might not be able to scrape the data effectively.
